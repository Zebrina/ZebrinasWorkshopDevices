- Made the Paint Mixer give two paints instead of one. 1 + 1 = 1? WTF?
- Reworked the Power Lifts. You will need to store existing Power Lift in the workshop and place them again. Sorry for the inconvenience!
- Power Lifts now only have one button on the lift itself. If a lift only has two floors the button will make the lift go between them. If it has more than two floors then a dialogue will appear where the destination floor can be selected.
- Power Lift panels can be detached/attached via configuration.
- The Power Lift stairs are now a separate object and there are three variants to choose from.
- The Powered Crane Bridges can now have their power state reversed. So that they will lower when powered. Can be changed via Pip-Bo config.
- Added a functioning teleporter system similar to the one used in a quest during the main story. By default requires that you complete said quest.
- Made Pip-Boy configuration require a special engineering weapon equipped and out. Can be disabled.
- Added some help pages accessible through the holotape provided.
- The holotape can now be crafted if one is not already present in your inventory.
- Added some workshop menu filters.
- Made the traps ignored by navmeshing, which should make the npcs not avoid them.
- Fixed collision not being immediately updated when placed for certain doors. Previously they would require reloading.
- Probably something else...
