# Zebrina's Workshop Devices
My Workshop Devices mod on nexusmods. :blush:

## Instructions:
This project is set up to be cloned inside the Mod Organizer 2 mods folder. Scripts are set up to be compiled using Atom and the papyrus package provided there.

In order to compile papyrus scripts after cloning the following files needs to be edited:
* \Scripts\Source\User\\.build-papyrus.yml
* \Scripts\Source\User\build-debug.ppj (This file is used to compile all scripts for debugging)
* \Scripts\Source\User\build-release.ppj (This file is used to compile all scripts for release)
